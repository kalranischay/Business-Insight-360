# Business Insights 360

## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware is growing rapidly in the recent years, and they have decided to implement the data analytics using PowerBi in their company for the first time to surpass their competitors in the market and to make data driven decisions. This project is hoped to give answers to the questions of stakeholder in terms all the aspects like finance, sales, marketing and supply chain.

I worked on this project by following the Codebasics Power BI Course.

## Company Background
AltiQ Hardware is a company that has experienced significant growth in recent years and has expanded its business globally. It sells computers and computer accessories through three channels:

- Retailers
- Direct
- Distributors

Recently, the company incurred an unforeseen loss by opening a store in America. Based on surveys, intuition, and some Excel analysis, the company's competitors have a significant advantage with their analytics teams, enabling data-driven decision-making. Therefore, AltiQ Hardware has no choice but to build its analytics team for better survival in the industry.

During the project kickoff session, it's essential to clarify the project's objectives and address any questions related to the project.

## Questions to Ask Before Starting with the Dashboard
- What is the objective of building this Power BI dashboard?
- In what terms will the success of this project be measured?
- What will be the project's deadline?
- Do stakeholders expect a preview before the actual release?
- What are all the hopes stakeholders have for this project?
- What are all the fears the stakeholders have regarding building this dashboard?
- Who will be using this dashboard and for what purpose?
- What are all the expectations stakeholders have upon the completion of this project?
- What can go wrong while building this project?
- What are all the resources/data needed to build this dashboard?
- Is there any input from stakeholders regarding the design and views of the dashboard?
- After the project kickoff meetings, the data engineering team has provided the data as requested by the data analytics team. Letâ€™s explore them.

## Dataset Understanding
Understanding the available data is crucial before analysis. Before diving into analysis, it's important to have a good understanding of the available data.

Dimension table: It contains static data such as customer and product details.

Fact table: It contains transaction data.

## Importing Data to Power BI
- As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from the MySQL database to Power BI by providing the database access credentials.

## Data Model
- Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered the foundation of a report. All visuals will be built upon the data model. 
- Poor data modeling can affect the overall performance of the report.
- Following good practices of data modeling is essential. In this project, we have followed the Snowflake data modeling method.
